# Sam Challenge

This challenge was to create an app with React and Nestjs on a subject of my choice. App should include a database with normally distributed data. The UI should show the normally distributed on a chart.

Wanted to dust off this project since its the stack I've been working in since I created it. I have updated this project with a seed file and commands. Then, added some new UI elements and comments.

## Running the Project

Clone the repository and navigate into folder.

```
git clone git@github.com:mmacdonald1/sam-challenge-web.git
cd sam-challenge-web
```

Use Yarn to install packages and start server

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

To see data, backend server must be running.

## Back-end Repo

https://github.com/mmacdonald1/sam-challenge

## Components

Main.js is the container component. Line.js graph is what you will see in the application, but I have left the Scatter.js component in if you want to see that too.
