# Sam Challenge

Hi Sam! Thank you for the opportunity. It was fun to get to know NestJs and work with React again. This project was inspired by quarantine bringing out my inner plant mother. The idea is to see how many of each type of plant are sold daily. I know you were thinking to visualize outliers with a scatter plot, but there is a line graph I've done in the past I think you will like. It makes outliers and trends more obvious.

## Back-end Repo

## Components

Main.js is the container component. Line.js graph is what you will see in the application, but I have left the Scatter.js component in if you want to see that too.
